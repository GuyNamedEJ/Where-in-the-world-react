## Optimizations
One of the first thing I would optimize is the UX of how someone schedules a vacation. I would also work on the scalability of the API used. Lastly I would make it so that a person can swipe with friends in real time.

## Lessons Learned

Utilized callback functions in the server to try and build a modular and scalable backend. Through this I learned , how to effectively simplify backend routes into independent functions
