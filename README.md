A React app that pulls data from a country api and displays cards for each country. Clicking a card will open it up to display
more information about it.

## Optimizations
There are a few CSS changes to make at different breakpoints. The code for validating data could be greatly improved upon. I will be making updates in the next few weeks to address it. I also forgot about implementing the dark mode. If I have time, I'll come back and add that later
